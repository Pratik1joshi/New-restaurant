/**
 * Deployment profile — restaurant-agnostic, driven entirely by env vars below.
 *
 * Two supported modes:
 *  - FULL_SERVICE (default): admin + waiter + kitchen + cashier all active,
 *    floor/table/KOT/kitchen-display workflow on.
 *  - COUNTER_READY_SERVE: single admin role, counter/ready-to-serve only.
 *    Staff roles are PRESERVED in the schema and codebase, just gated off.
 *
 * Env overrides (optional):
 *   RESTAURANT_MODE=FULL_SERVICE|COUNTER_READY_SERVE
 *   POS_ENABLED_ROLES="admin,waiter,kitchen,cashier" (admin is always included)
 * Keep this module dependency-free so it is safe to import from middleware.
